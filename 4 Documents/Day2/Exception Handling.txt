Exception Handling

Two type of exceptions
o Check
	- Exceptions that inherit from a class Exception but not from RuntimeException
	- Compiler enforces a catch-or-declare requirements
	- Could handle the exception and have another way
o Uncheck
	- Inherit from class RuntimeException or class Error
	- Happens in runtime
	- RuntimeExceptions

When to use exception handling
o Exception handling designed to process synchronous errors
o Synchronous errors - occur when a statement executes
o Assynchronous errors - occur in parallel w/ and independent of the program's flow of control




NOTES:
o Applet vs Servlet (App-Application(Client side) | Serv-Server(Server side)) 
o Don't use exceptions as break on a program
o Memory leak - Opening something that you don't close
o Exceptions occured on the FINALLY block could overright the exception occured on the TRY block
o Avoid putting code that could throws an exception on the FINALLY block
o Exceptions are possible program related while errors are possible hardware related
o J2SE VS J2EE
