-----------------------------------
--- JS & DOM ----------------------
-----------------------------------
DHTML
o a combination of several built-in browser feature for fourth generation browsers more dynamic
o is NOT a scripting language but a browser feature- or enhancement- that makes the browser dynamic
o uses a host of different technologies - the JS, VBscript, the DOM, layers, CSS - to create HTML that can change
o made up of HTML, CSS, Scripting language. All three are map on DOM

Tools of DHTML
o HTML and XML 
	- Partitions and Organizes the content
o CS 
	- Defines the Presentation of the content
o Scripting (JavaScript, Jscript, VBScript) 
	- Adds interactivity to the page
o DOM 
	- Define what and how elements are exposed for script access

DOM
o a platform and language neutral interface allowing programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and style of the element
o is not part of scripting language
o both ()EI and Netscape) DOMs break down web pages into roughly for type of component
s	- Objects, Properties, Events, and Methods
	- Properties
	- Methods 
	- Events

Nodes
o The W3C DOM defines the elements of a document is a node of particular type

Node Types
o Common types are: document node, element node, text node, 

PROS and CONS
o PROS
	- Robust API forDOM tree
	- Relatively simple to modify data structure

o CONS
	-


JavaScript
o There are three type of object

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScaript and XML)
o a web development technique from creating interactive web applications
o if you know JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and XML, then you need to spend just one hour to start w/ Ajax
o is a new technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications w/ the help of XML, HTML, CSS, and JavaSCript
o uses XHTML for content, CSS for presentation, along w/ DOM and JavaScript for dynamic content display
o Makes the website more asynchronize

Rich Internet Application Technology
o AJAX mostly viable Rich Internet Application (RIA) technology so far. It is getting tremendous industry momentum and several tool kit and framework are emerging. 

Steps of AJAX Operation
1 A client event occurs
2 An XMLHttpRequest object is created
3 The XMLHttpRequest object is configured
4 The XMLHttpRequest object makes an asynchronous request to the Webserver
5 The Webserver return the result containing XML document
6 XMLHttpRequest object calls the callback() function and process the result
7 The HTML DOM is updated

XMLHttpRequest

---------------------------
--- JSON & XML ------------
---------------------------
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
o language independent
o most programming language can easily red it and instantiate objects or some other data structure
o a language used to create other language
o JSON must have no duplicate keys like in databases
o A JSON can have en empty array ("[]") or an array with null value ("[null]")
o JSON chars are a superset of XML chars
o simpler than XML and more compact
o has a better fir for OO systems than XML
o not as extensible as XML
o Preferred for simple data exchange by many
o Less syntax, no semantics
o No schemas required


XML
o a language used to create other language






NOTES!!!
- DOM (Document-Object-Model) implements as a tree (heirarchy)
- DOM is an API, built in most of the browsers
- DOM is an HTML object
- DOM is a language neutral interface
- Client-side object are create by browsers
- Microsoft IE and Netscape doe not share the same DOM
- JavaScript is hard to debug
- AJAX is open standard
