TDD
o turns traditional development around
	- Write test code before the methods
	- Do so in very small steps


Benefit:
o Rapid feedback
o Interface before algorithm
o Know when you're finished
o Change the code with confidence

Principles of TDD
o maintains an enhaustive suite of Programmer Tests
o no code goes into production unless it has associated tests
o write the test first
o determine what code needed to write if programming by intention
	- then you are designing as you write tests

o JS was introduces as part of Netscape 2.0 browser
