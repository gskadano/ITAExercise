--- Functional Programming -----------
--------------------------------------
o Functional program have no side effect
o Functional program is immutable
o Functional program does not interfere with other interface
o No Exception throwing
o Concerns on the input and the output

--- Java Script ----------------------

Request and Response

Server side
o Accepts a request
o Decides whether to:
	- send a request to anothr server
	- send a response to the client

Client side
o The "Browser"
o Javascript handles the client side


Why use client-side programming?
o PHP already allows us to create dynamicweb pages. Why also use client-side scripting?
	- Client-side scripting (JS)
		~ Usability
		~ Efficiency
		~ event-driven
	- server-side prgoramming (PHP) benefits:
		~ security
		~ compatibility
		~ power

Javascript
o A lightweight programming language ("scripting language")
	- used to make web pages interactive
	- insert dynamic test into HTML (e.g. user name)
	- react to events (e.g. page load user click)
	- get information about a user's computer (e.g. browser tpye)
	- perform calculations on user's computer (e.g. form validation)

Javascript vs Java
o interpreted, not compile
o more relaxed syntax and rules


Javascript vs PHP
o similarities:
	- both are interpreted, not compiled
	- both are relaxed about syntax, rules, and types
	- both a re case sensitive

o differences
	- JS is more object-oriented

NOTES!!!
- Scripting language does not need to compile
- Scripting language are mostly a list of commands
- Java script is event-driven



To-Do:
- Review on JavaScript / HTML / CSS
