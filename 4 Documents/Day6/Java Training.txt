--- Java Concurrency and Multithreading ----
--------------------------------------------
Sequential Programming 
o Doing a task from A-Z, one step at a time

Simulating Parallel Programming
o Removing the sequential assumption creates bth opportunities and challenges
	- Pogramming
		~ Divide work among threads of execution and coordinate (synchronize) them
	- Algorithms
		~ more throughput: work done per unit wall-clock time - speedup
		~ more origanization required
	- Data structure
		~ May need to support concurrent access (multipple thread operating on data at the same time)

Problems that might encounter on Parallel programming
o Resources
o Data access
o Exceptions
o Programming level

Multitasking and Multithreading
o Multitasking, the ablility of a computer to do multiple jobs

What are Threads
o A thread is like the electricity passing through the wire to the devices. A single or multiple wire can power the devices to run

Advantages of Thread
o Easier to program
o Can provide better performance

Disadvantages of Threads
o Multiple threads can lead to deadlock
o Overhead of switching between threads

Parallel  Processing
o Multi-Processor Systems
o Multi-Code CPUs

Creating Threads
o Extends "Thread"
o Implementing "Runnable" class

Thread Methods
o void Start()
o void run()
o sleep(int m) / sleep(int m, int n)
	- the thread sleeps for m (millisecond), plus n (nanoseconds)
o yield
	- Causes the currently executing thread object to temporarily pause and allow other threads to execute

Implementing "Runnable"


State of Java Threads
o New - Created not started
o Runnable - Created, started not able to run
o Blocked - Created and started but
o Dead - 


------------------------------------
--- Java Regular Expression --------
------------------------------------
o A way to represent patterns by strings
o The matcher converts a pattern into a finite 




NOTES!!!
- Multitasking have two level
	~ Operating System level
	~ Language level (Programming language level). In java, it is called thread
- In OS level, a task is called a process. In Language level, it is called a thread
- Process have threads
- Process is a single task
- Threads can have a sub thread

Questions:
o How to escape deadlock
o How do Runnable set prioritize
o How do Threads run
